Complete rewrite of [FreezerBot Chilly](https://github.com/dexmoh/FreezerBot) in Python and Discord.py

For all of the changes and improvements check out the [changelog](/changelog.md).

For any further details or inquiries, message `dexmoh` on discord, or open an issue in this repository.

## About
This is a complete rewrite of a discord bot I wrote a couple of years ago for a small server of friends I'm a part of.

Chilly's main feature is the ability to pin and save images under a keyword that you can later look up, this is useful if you want to circumvent Discord's pin limit.

Chilly has a chatbot feature where sometimes he will spew nonsense at random, or if you ping him. The chatbot uses simple [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) to generate lines of text, most of the times its nonesense, but 10% of the time its funny nonsense. The chatbot can train itself on new discord messages, but it will only pick up those messages from servers that have been whitelisted in the bot's configuration files.

## Installation
To be added soon™️...

## License
The code is released under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](/LICENSE).

## Invite
Bot invite links are no longer public, but Chilly won't leave any servers it's already been part of.
